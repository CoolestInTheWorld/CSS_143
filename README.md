A storage for my school work if I ever wish to return and see what I did.

If you're reading this and you aren't me, then chances are you're probably looking for help on either the homework or labs. I did decide to 
make these files public for this reason, but remember to keep academic dishonesty/ misconduct in mind. If you're here to understand how to 
create a certain method, feel free to look at the way I completed it. If you're hear to copy answers, I will personally shove a "I told you
so" down your throat when you get caught.
